		<h1>Rules</h1>

		<h2>Mandatory rules</h2>
		
		<p>- You're not allowed to create any extra tag in HTML or javascript. Use only the ones available inside the USEFUL MARKUP comments.</p>
		<p>- Keep your css and javascript code organized for a good readability</p>
		<p>- You'll create a crossing. There are 2 one-way streets. The traffic moves from left to right in horizontal road and from top to bottom in vertical road. There are 4 blocks, and the viewport is limited by those 4 blocks. The cars shouldn't appear outside this viewport.</p>
		<p>- You should reproduce the CSS as most as similar to the image called <a href="reference.png">reference.png</a> attached in this folder. Do not use background images in this exercise.</p>
		<p>- <strong>Traffic lights rules:</strong> The lights should toggle every 15 seconds (both must be red during 3 seconds before toggle the lights). A car should never pass trough a red light in his road.</p>

		<h2>Recommendations</h2>

		<p>- Every car should move between 50px and 92px per second.</p>
		<p>- The cars should move smooth.</p>
		<p>- Try use javascript without any framework.</p>
